## 01. Route Auditing

Operational support tool developed to assist in the balancing/audit process and cart checking, especially in situations involving system issues, counting discrepancies, or errors when drivers submit package counts.

The main goal is to ensure that the route is properly audited, allowing the operator to perform the verification quickly and efficiently through an intelligent checklist logic.

## Features

- **Real-Time Checklist:** The list of expected IDs is displayed on screen and automatically checked off as scans occur.  
- **Smart Validation (Regex):** Automatically filters label scans (11 digits), treating out-of-pattern codes (such as 44-digit DANFEs) as "Invalid".  
- **Color-Coded Visual Feedback:**  
  - ⚪ **Gray:** Item waiting to be scanned.  
  - 🟢 **Green:** Item successfully verified.  
  - 🟠 **Orange:** "Extra" item (11-digit ID not present in the base list).  
  - 🔴 **Red:** "Invalid" item (label out of pattern or scan error).  
- **Duplicate Handling:** Removes repeated IDs from the database and alerts the user if the same package is scanned more than once.  
- **CSV Export:** Generates a complete report containing verified, missing, and exception items.  
- **Offline Mode:** Runs entirely in the browser, with no need for a database or internet connection after the initial load.


## 2. Master Label Generator (In Development)

Module for local generation of master labels, designed for situations where reprinting via *Logistics* is unavailable (file missing) or for creating *Dummy Boxes*.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Responsive interface following the "Mercado Livre" visual identity.

- **Git & GitHub:** Version control and deployment.
