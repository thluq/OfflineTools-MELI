## 01. Route Auditing

Operational support tool developed to assist in the balancing/audit process and cart checking, especially in situations involving system issues, counting discrepancies, or errors when drivers submit package counts.

The main goal is to ensure that the route is properly audited, allowing the operator to perform the verification quickly and efficiently through an intelligent checklist logic.

## Features

- **Real-Time Checklist:** The list of expected IDs is displayed on screen and automatically checked off as scans occur.  
- **Smart Validation (Regex):** Automatically filters label scans (11 digits), treating out-of-pattern codes (such as 44-digit DANFEs) as "Invalid".   
- **Duplicate Handling:** Removes repeated IDs from the database and alerts the user if the same package is scanned more than once.  
- **CSV Export:** Generates a complete report containing verified, missing, and exception items.  

## 2. Label Generator 

Module for local generation of package labels, designed for situations where reprinting through *Logistics* is unavailable (e.g., missing file) or for creating *Dummy Boxes*.

## Features

* **Input:** Fields for destination facility, origin facility, cluster, promise, and Seller/Buyer information.
* **Barcode and QR Code Generation:** Local processing using lightweight libraries (JsBarcode and QRCode.js).
